# Ransomware
Hello there! i just tried to make Ransomware. It is not as powerful as a real ransomware but still it works well, more  updates to come.

# make a new directory and clone the repo there

# for installing the modules  
pip install -r requirements.txt

# to run the file make sure you have python installed then type the following command
python3 ransomware.py

#enjoy
